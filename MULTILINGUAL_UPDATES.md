# Multilingual & Smart Recommendation Updates

## 🎯 Overview

The chatbot has been enhanced with two major features:

1. **Intelligent Product Recommendation Detection** - Only shows products when actually needed
2. **Indonesian Language Support** - Fully bilingual (English + Bahasa Indonesia)

## 🔧 Key Changes Made

### 1. Smart Recommendation Logic

**Before:** Always searched for products and returned recommendations for every query.

**After:** Uses OpenAI to intelligently determine if the user is asking for product recommendations.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Cleaner responses for general questions
- ✅ Faster response times for non-product queries
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ More contextually appropriate conversations

### 2. Multilingual Support

**Languages Supported:**
- 🇺🇸 **English** - Full support
- 🇮🇩 **Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)** - Full support

**Features:**
- Automatic language detection
- Responds in the same language as the user
- Supports language switching mid-conversation
- Multilingual product recommendations
- Bilingual error messages

## 🚀 How It Works

### Smart Recommendation Detection

The system analyzes user messages using OpenAI to determine intent:

```python
# Examples that WILL trigger product recommendations:
"I need a laptop for business"           # ✅ Products shown
"Saya butuh laptop untuk kerja"         # ✅ Products shown  
"What's the price of MacBook Pro?"      # ✅ Products shown
"Compare Dell vs HP laptops"            # ✅ Products shown

# Examples that will NOT trigger recommendations:
"Tell me about your company"            # ❌ No products
"Ceritakan tentang perusahaan kalian"   # ❌ No products
"What's your warranty policy?"          # ❌ No products
"Hello, how are you?"                   # ❌ No products
```

### Language Detection Keywords

**Indonesian Keywords:** saya, butuh, perlu, cari, mau, ingin, untuk, yang, apa, bagaimana, rekomendasikan, sarankan, harga, spesifikasi, etc.

**English Keywords:** laptop, computer, need, looking for, want, buy, recommend, suggest, price, specs, compare, etc.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the multilingual test script:

```bash
python test_multilingual.py
```

This tests:
- ✅ English product queries → should return products
- ✅ Indonesian product queries → should return products  
- ✅ English general queries → should NOT return products
- ✅ Indonesian general queries → should NOT return products
- ✅ Language consistency in responses
- ✅ Conversation context maintenance

## 📊 API Response Changes

### Previous Response (Always included products):
```json
{
  "response": "TechPro Solutions was founded in 2018...",
  "suggested_products": [
    {"name": "MacBook Pro", "price": 1999.99},
    {"name": "Dell XPS", "price": 1299.99}
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.45
}
```

### New Response (Only when relevant):
```json
{
  "response": "TechPro Solutions was founded in 2018...",
  "suggested_products": null,
  "confidence_score": null
}
```

## 🌍 Example Conversations

👤 User: "I need a laptop under $1500"  
🤖 Bot: "I'd recommend the Dell XPS 13 Plus for $1299..."
📦 Products: Dell XPS 13, MacBook Air, HP Spectre
```

### Indonesian Conversation:
